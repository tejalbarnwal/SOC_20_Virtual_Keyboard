```python

import cv2

img = cv2.imread('messi5.jpg')

print(img.shape) # returns a tuple of number of rows, columns and channels in this order
print(img.size) # returns total number of pixels inside the image which is accessed
print(img.dtype) # returns image datatype
b,g,r = cv2.split(img) # (returns three values) splits image (taken as argument) in 3 channels blue, green and red in order
img = cv2.merge((b,g,r)) # takes the channels in the form of tuples; merges the blue, green and red channels into an image

ball = img[280:340, 330:390] # y coordinate min to max(getting desired rows), x coordinate min to max(getting desired columns) (values in the bracket)
# this assigns the desired matrix (which contains information about our roi) from the main image to a new variable ball
img[273:333, 100:160] = ball
# this changes the pixels (of desired location of indexing) in main image to that of ball

img2 = cv2.imread('opencv-logo.png')
#dst = cv2.add(img, img2)
# the above commented line will lead to an error as images with different size cannot be added
img = cv2.resize(img, (512,512))
# first argument in this method is the source and second is the required size(no of rows, no of columns)
img2 = cv2.resize(img2, (512,512)) # now these two can be added
dst = cv2.add(img, img2)

dst2 = cv2.addWeighted(img, 0.9, img2, 0.1, 0)
# this method adds two images with a specified weight, first argument will be the first source (image), second will be the required weight of first source (alpha), third is the source two, fourth is the weight of second image (beta), fifth argument is the gama value which is a scalar value to be added
